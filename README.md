# Fork of the .NET Disruptor with WorkerPool DSL support

My fork is a Disruptor 2.10.1 to which I ported the support of WorkerPool in DSL from the latest Java Disruptor.

## Readme of the original project

This project aims to provide the full functionality of the Disruptor to CLR projects.

## What's new?

12/7/2013 (v2.10.1):

* All features available in Java Disruptor **2.10.1** have been ported 
* Using [GitInfoPlanter] to push git information into binary assemblies
* More use of NuGet for all dependencies

[GitInfoPlanter]: http://damageboy.github.io/daemaged.gitinfoplanter/

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started with the disruptor is by using the [NuGet package]

## Build from source and run tests

You may also build disruptor directly from the source:
* you need Visual Studio 2010
* run build.bat, it will compile, run the tests and output binaries and results into Target folder

You can then run the performance tests: runPerfTest.bat

[NuGet package]: http://nuget.org/packages/Disruptor
